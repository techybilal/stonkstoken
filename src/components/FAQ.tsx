      question: "Will STNK go to the moon? ðŸš€",
      answer: "Absolutely! Our proprietary rocket technology ensures we bypass the moon and head straight to Andromeda. Terms and conditions apply in this universe."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this a scam or a rug pull?",
      answer: "How dare you! STNK is 100% legitimate digital art representing the concept of going up. Our rugs are firmly secured with diamond-reinforced adhesive."
    },
    {
      question: "What gives STNK its value?",
      answer: "Pure internet magic, meme energy, and the collective belief of 69,420 holders that numbers only go up. Also, we have a really cool logo."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I lose money with STNK?",
      answer: "Impossible! Our advanced stonk technology prevents any downward movement. Money can only be temporarily relocated to other dimensions."
    },
    {
      question: "When Lambo?",
      answer: "Lambo delivery is scheduled for next Tuesday, or the Tuesday after that. Possibly the Tuesday after the Tuesday after that. Definitely a Tuesday though."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I buy STNK?",
      answer: "Simply believe in the power of stonks, click our 'Buy' button, and watch as your portfolio achieves levels of green previously thought impossible by physics."
    },
    {
      question: "Is STNK environmentally friendly?",
      answer: "Yes! STNK runs on 100% renewable meme energy. Each transaction plants a virtual tree in the metaverse and feeds a digital unicorn."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I sell my STNK?",
      answer: "The system is designed to prevent such catastrophic events. However, if you somehow manage to sell, you forfeit your membership to the diamond hands club forever."
